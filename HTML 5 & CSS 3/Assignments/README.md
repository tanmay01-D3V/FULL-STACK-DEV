# Assignments — HTML 5 & CSS 3

This folder contains small assignment pages demonstrating HTML and CSS techniques. The files are intended for learning and experimentation.

Files included:

- `9th_jan.html` — A page demonstrating internal (embedded) CSS using a <style> block. Try editing the styles inside the file to see how page-specific CSS works.
- `All_in_one.html` — A combined demo page with multiple examples; uses internal CSS to keep examples self-contained.
- `9th_jan_README.md` — Per-file README describing internal CSS usage for `9th_jan.html`.
- `All_in_one_README.md` — Per-file README describing internal CSS usage for `All_in_one.html`.

Notes:
- "Internal CSS" refers to styles placed inside a page's <style> tag; it's useful for page-scoped styling and quick experiments.
- When you move to larger projects, prefer external stylesheets to keep styles reusable across pages.

Short message: "Something CSS: internal application and more"
