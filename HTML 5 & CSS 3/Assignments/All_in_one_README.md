# All_in_one.html — Internal CSS application and more

This README accompanies `All_in_one.html`.

- Purpose: Example page combining multiple HTML & CSS examples; includes internal CSS to style elements on the page.
- Notes: Internal styles (inside <style> tags) are used to demonstrate how CSS can be applied per-page.
- Keywords: internal CSS, examples, combined demo, selectors, styles.

Additional info:
- Open `All_in_one.html` in a browser to inspect the embedded <style> block and experiment by changing values.
- Good for learning before moving styles to an external stylesheet.
